            <em>Instructions</em>
        </h2>

        <p>
            The study will consist of two practice rounds and ten regular decision-making rounds.
            Your performance in the regular rounds counts towards your final earned amount, while the practice round does not count.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each round, the sequence of action is illustrated below.
            In every step, new information will appear at the top of the screen, so please have a look at it carefully
            before you make any decision or proceed to the next step.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each period, you will have the opportunity to vote in an election.
            One candidate is of PARTY K and the other one is of PARTY J.
        </p>
        <p><em>
             Your payoff in each round will depend on the quality of the election winner and on the distance of
            your ideological position from the ideological position of the winner.
        </em>
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Candidate Quality</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            For each candidate a random number is drawn from an urn.
            The numbers in the urn are between 1 and 120 and each is equally likely to be selected.
            This ‘quality number’ reflects the competency of the candidate in handling policy matters.
            The higher is the number the better is the quality of the candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
            This number is redrawn every period for each candidate.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Informed and Uninformed Participants</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            Every period some participants are told the quality numbers for two candidates, e.g. “Candidate J’s quality is 10 and candidate K’s quality is 24.”
            These are the informed participants. The rest of the participants receive no additional information.
            Who receives this information is determined by the ideological positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants with positions {1,2,3,5,7,9,11} are informed.
            Participants with positions {4,6,8,10,12,13,14,15} are uninformed.
            This fact does not change across rounds.
        </p>
      <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Ideological Positions and Payoffs</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            At the start of each period you will be given a ‘position number’ between 1 and 15.
            This number affects how you value the positions of the two candidates.
            Candidate of Party J is in position 6 and candidate of Party K is in position 10.
            These positions remain fixed for both candidates for the entirety of the study, but your position may change every period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your ‘ideological score’ from the victory of each candidate is equal to 100 points minus 5 times the difference between your position and the candidate’s position.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you are in position 3, and candidate K takes position 10, then your ‘ideological payoff’ from K’s victory is:
            <center>100-5*|3-10|=65</center>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that, on top of this ideological score, you earn an additional score equal to the winner’s quality.
            For instance, if candidate K wins the election and his quality is 25, then your total payoff is:
            <center>65+25=90 </center>
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
           <em> Polls</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            After the ‘informed voters’ receive their information, five polling companies will conduct voting intention polls.
            In each poll, four out of the fifteen participants will be randomly chosen to state their voting preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                This means that you may be asked to state your voting intention by one polling company, or by many, or by none.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are contacted by many companies, you only have to state your answer once, and the same answer will be used for all of them.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Information about Poll Results</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            After polls have taken place, the findings of the five companies will be revealed.
            All participants will observe the fraction of votes that each of the two candidates received in the polls of
            these five companies.
        </p>
        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Beliefs about Election Results</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
            After the poll results have been announced to you, and before elections take place,
            you will be asked to state the vote share that you expect each candidate to receive in the upcoming elections.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Elections and Payoffs</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            In the end of each period, elections take place, where each participant may vote or abstain.
            The winner of the election is determined by simple majority. In case of a draw, each candidate receives an equal chance of being selected as the winner.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            <em>Round Payoffs and Aggregate Payoffs from the Study</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
            As described earlier, your total payoff from each round is the sum of the winner’s quality and your ‘ideological payoffs’ from the candidate’s victory.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Your total payoffs from this study will be the sum of all payoffs that you accumulate in each round.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            They will be paid to you in cash, at the end of the study. Each earned point will correspond to <strong>half a penny</strong>. You will now participate in one practice round.
            If you have any questions, please raise your hand and your question will be addressed individually.
